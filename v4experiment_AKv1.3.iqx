BACKGROUND INFO

											*Purpose*
To assess the difference in percieved realness of different photos based on a participants level of Depersonalisation/Derealisation (DPDR).											

											  *Task*
Images taken by different cameras (post-processed) are flashed in front of the participant briefly. Afterwards, a rating scale is presented
requiring the participant to rate the percieved "realness" of the photo they have just seen. After a set of these photos (and associated rating scales) 
are presented, the user is prompted to conduct a Cambridge DPDR test where their responses will describe how much they are experiencing DPDR 

************DATA FILE INFORMATION: 
The default data stored in the data files are:

(1) Raw data file: 'PictureStoryExercise_raw*.iqdat' (a separate file for each participant)

build:							Inquisit build
computer.platform:				the platform the script was run on
date, time, subject, group:		date and time script was run with the current subject/groupnumber 
blockcode, blocknum:			the name and number of the current block
trialcode, trialnum: 			the name and number of the currently recorded trial
									(Note: not all trials that are run might record data; by default data is collected unless /recorddata = false is set for a particular trial/block) 
response:						the participant's response (openended response)
latency: 						the response latency

(2) Summary data file: 'PictureStoryExercise_summary*.iqdat' (a separate file for each participant)

script.startdate:				date script was run
script.starttime:				time script was started
script.subjectid:				subject id number
script.groupid:					group id number
script.elapsedtime:				time it took to run script (in ms)
computer.platform:				the platform the script was run on
/completed:						0 = script was not completed (prematurely aborted); 1 = script was completed (all conditions run)***************************


EXPERIMENTAL SET-UP
* 25 pictures - order is determined randomly
* pictures are presented for 1 second
* Then a rating scale appears where the participant chooses a value of "realness"
* A DPDR scale is presented after all the images and associated ratings are completed
